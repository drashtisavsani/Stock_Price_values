# Stock-Price-Direction-Prediction

A machine learning project to predict stock price direction (Buy/Sell) using models like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training,evaluation and plot graph. The best-performing model is used to make real-time predictions, and the results are visualized by comparing cumulative returns of the trading strategy against the market.

# Tools and Technologies Used : 

  Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, model building, and analysis.
  
  Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning models like Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
  
  Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for writing code, running codes, and visualizing results.
  
  Yahoo Finance: For sourcing historical stock price data.
